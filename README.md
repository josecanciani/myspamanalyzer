# MySpamAnalyzer
(originally hosted in code.google.com/p/myspamanalyzer, automatically exported here).

This is a very old project to scan my SPAM folder and detect what addresses are messages being sent to.

It's devided in two parts:
* a script to be croned that connects to your email account and reads your spam folder.
* a webpage that shows you graphs about your spam emails.

Originally this project used LibGmailer to contact Gmail server.

Moving to IMAP would be great so it can be used to connect to more servers.
