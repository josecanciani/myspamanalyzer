## This project is devided in two: ##

  1. a script to be croned that connects to your email account and reads your spam folder.
  1. a webpage that shows you graphs about your spam emails.

Originally this project used LibGmailer to contact Gmail server. We'll be moving to IMAP soon so it can be used to connect to any email client with IMAP support.
